Program designed to pull player stats and coaching styles together to predict potential future sleepers

Phase 1: Interact and pull in Pro-Football-Reference.com player stats
  - Positions of interest: QB, RB, WR, TE
Phase 2: Pull in coach history and team ranks of offensive stats (Pro-Football-Reference)
  - First focus on HC and Coordinator postions
  - Extra step would incorporate Position coach, but that might require extra website interface (Wiki?)
